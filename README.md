### Hey, I'm Davin 👋
I'm an IT professional with over 12 years experience across the UK & NZ, pivoting into web development. 

During the global pandemic in 2020 I completed a 4 month web development bootcamp, covering LAMP & MERN stacks and agile working methods. Since then, I try and contribute to GH almost every day. I'm interested in backend technologies like PHP, Node, Java, MYSQL and GraphQL APIs.

I'm open to opportunities working as a backend or full stack developer in the UK, or remotely. My portfolio website contains examples of my work and I've recently published my first blog article in Jan 2022! - https://davin2020.github.io/

I'm  interested in psychology and wellbeing, making short films, travelling and the design & architecture of almost everything from housing to software.   <br></br>

- psychology related apps, especially if your into NVC by Marshall Rosenberg  <br></br>

#### ⚡ Fun facts: ...
* I (used to) travel and have visited over 15 countries in the last 15 years - I really liked Singapore and Rotterdam for their architecture and public spaces.
* I collect t-shirts from the places I've been and the things I've  done.
* I've climbed Mt Kinabalu in Borneo 2.5 times - its half as high as Everest and you can see the curvature of the Earth from the summit.
* I volunteered in Thailand after the 2004 tsunami and helped villagers build 106 houses for their families - so I can bricklay and screed concrete floors to Thai standards, and operate the tiny 2 tonne digger.
* When I taught myself the Thai alphabet, I discovered it has 44 consonants (and 32 vowels!) - the first constonant is `chicken`, the second one is `egg` and the last one is `owl` - so the chicken really does come before the egg!
* I can make a basic [croquembouche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquembouche), which is a very technical cake, although it takes me about 5 hours.
* I aspire to have the most [Killjoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killjoys) themed repos on GH - so far I've got 2!
