### Hey, I'm Davin ðŸ‘‹
I'm an IT professional with 12 years experience across the UK & NZ, pivoting into web development. 

I've recently completed a bootcamp covering LAMP & MERN stacks, and would like to work with GraphQL more.
I'm interested in working as a backend of full stack developer in the UK, or remotely

I'm  interested in psychology, making short film, travelling and the design & architecture of almost everything from housing to software

- âš¡ Fun facts: ...
* I collect tshirts from the places I've been and the things I've have done
* I've climbed Mt Kinabalu in Borneo 2.5 times - its half as high as Everest and you can see the curvature of the Earth from the summit
* I volunteered in Thailand after the 2004 tsunami and helped villagers build 106 houses for their families
* When I taught myself the Thai alphabet, I found out it has 44 consonants - the first one is `chicken`, the second one is `egg` and the last one is `owl` - so the chicken does come before the egg!
* I can make a simple [croquembouche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquembouche), although it takes me about 5 hours
* I aspire to have the most [Killjoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killjoys) themed repos on GH - so far I've made a start with 1!
