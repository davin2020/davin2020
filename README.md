### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an IT professional with 12 years experience across the UK & NZ, pivoting into web development. 

I've recently completed a bootcamp covering LAMP & MERN stacks, and would like to work with GraphQL more.
I'm interested in working as a backend of full stack developer in the UK, or remotely

I'm  interested in psychology, making short film, travelling and the design & architecture of almost everything from housing to software
